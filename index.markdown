## Projects

### ["Tales of Fablecraft"](https://fablecraft.riftweaver.com/) for [Riftweaver Game Studio](https://riftweaver.com)

We're coding systems for this *"virtual tabletop RPG. It’s easy for GMs and players to learn, whether you've slain many dragons or are completely new to the genre. Fablecraft features its own system, gorgeous human-made art, pre-built campaigns that eliminate prep, and a growing list of homebrew tools."*

### ["Eel Afield" / "He tuna kei tua"](https://www.heihei.nz/game/180/eel-afield) for [HEIHEI Games (TVNZ + NZ On Air)](https://www.heihei.nz/games)

We made a storybook action-adventure browser game about navigating Aotearoa New Zealand's waterways as a young tuna (longfin eel). Features 8 levels of colorful characters like pūkeko philosophers and paradise duck princesses, as well as hazards like hungry kingfishers and scary hydro turbines, all in a vibrant New Zealand setting. Includes full te reo Māori localization. In collaboration with illustrator [Dave Hill](https://davehillustration.co.uk/).

### ["Tumble Time"](https://www.devolvertumbletime.com/) for [NOPOPO](http://nopopo.fun/) / [Devolver Digital](https://www.devolverdigital.com/)

We're handling all technical development and integrations for Tumble Time, a sarcastic yet engaging free-to-play mobile game featuring IP across indie publisher Devolver Digital's entire catalog.

### ["We Dwell in Possibility"](https://virtual-factory.co.uk/) for [Manchester International Festival](https://mif.co.uk/)

In collaboration with illustrator [Eleanor Davis](https://doing-fine.com/), we made a lush garden simulation as a commission for MIF's "Virtual Factory" programme. Despite its high res graphics and thousands of animation frames, we crunched all the files down to a 22 mb footprint suitable for a HTML5 web target -- compatible across iOS, Android, and desktop browsers.
