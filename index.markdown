## What we've made

### ["Tumble Time"](https://www.devolvertumbletime.com/) for [NOPOPO](http://nopopo.fun/) / [Devolver Digital](https://www.devolverdigital.com/)

We're handling all technical development and integrations for Tumble Time, a sarcastic yet engaging free-to-play mobile game featuring IP across indie publisher Devolver Digital's entire catalog. Coming soon to iOS and Android. (press:

### ["We Dwell in Possibility"](https://virtual-factory.co.uk/) for [Manchester International Festival](https://mif.co.uk/)

In collaboration with illustrator Eleanor Davis, we designed and developed a lush interactive simulation game as an arts commission for the Manchester International Festival's "Virtual Factory" 2021 programme. Although it contains dozens of different objects across thousands of animation frames, we crunched all the game files down into a 22 mb footprint suitable for a HTML5 web format -- compatible across iOS, Android, and desktop browsers.
