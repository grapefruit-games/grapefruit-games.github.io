## THE SPORTS GAME *can't* think about sports.

- **The Sports Game ignores our everyday experiences of sports.** <br /> *The Sports Game doesn't take kids to practice, play pick-up games with friends, or scream at the TV.*
- **The Sports Game flattens athletes into pawns with no lives.** <br /> *The Sports Game can't prank teammates on the bus, struggle to fall asleep before the finals, or tie shoes five times for good luck.*
- **The Sports Game pretends culture, politics, and tech don't influence sports.** <br /> *The Sports Game won't address sports betting, sportswashing, or steroids - powerful forces shaping every pro league today.*

Perhaps it's unfair to demand that The Sports Game must think about all aspects of sports, even the parts it can't easily monetize. OK, you win, The Sports Game: you have our permission to never change! Stay safe, stay the same, year after year!

The rest of us desire freedom. **To escape the prison of The Sports Game, we must invent a new genre.**

## THE SPORTSLIKE *can* think about sports.

- **The Sportslike** is much *like* a Sports Game.
- However, **The Sportslike** is also *not* a Sports Game. It's a different game genre with different conventions.
- Because it isn't a Sports Game, **The Sportslike can think about sports.**

## A brief guide - how to think about sports with SPORTSLIKES

1. **Think about your favorite sports books, shows, or movies.** <br /> *Imagine a sportslike about a high school football coach trying to do the right thing, a clueless tourist coaching a pro soccer team, or a ragtag heist underneath a race track.*
2. **Think about real-life people in real-life sports.** <br /> *Picture a sportslike about a breakdancing professor, sharpshooting cyberpunk, overly-endowed gymnast, or a teenage darts prodigy who's never needed a fake ID.*
3. **Think about sports news, politics, or history.** <br /> *Visualize a sportslike about a basketball superstar trying to fall asleep after getting traded with no warning, or a sportslike about an unlikable schoolboy who spoils a football match by picking up the ball and running with it.*

- It's most obvious when a game thinks via in-game text / audio / visuals, but it is also possible for a game to think via its overall design, systems, or community.
- To think about a sport, you don't have to recreate an entire sport. Only recreate what you need. Sometimes what you need is none.

## Where to find SPORTSLIKES

We wrote the Sportslike Manifesto to crystalize our thinking for our upcoming game [Tryhard](https://tryhardgame.com), *"a sports RPG about managing an underdog rugby club in New Zealand."*

But here's some other games that we consider to be sportslikes:

- [Golf Story (2017)](https://sidebargames.com/golfstory/), is *"the story of a golfer, forced to give up all that he holds dear for one final shot at accomplishing his dream."*
- [Roller Drama (2023)](https://www.open-lab.com/games/rollerdrama/) is *"a narrative and a strategic real-time sports game about five girls playing roller derby in an oppressive and surveillance-based society."*
- [Sudden Death (2024)](https://dominoclub.itch.io/sudden-death) is *a "romantic sports fiction" visual novel about a renegade Australian Rules Football club in a speculative future league.*
- [Despelote (2025)](https://despelote.game) is *"a slice-of-life adventure about childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001."*

Thank you for supporting new sports games; thank you for supporting sportslikes.
