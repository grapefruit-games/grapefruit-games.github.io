## Sports are made of people, but sports games aren't.

**Sports games don't** take kids to practice, play a pick-up game with friends, or scream at the TV.

**Sports games can't** smell the locker room, rub aching muscles, or tie shoes five times for good luck. 

**Sports games won't** ever care about all the people who live in sports: spectator and player, amateur and pro, young and old.

## SPORTSLIKES are games about people who live in sports.

Imagine a sportslike about a high school football coach trying to keep his soul, an American tourist gleefully ignorant about soccer, or a clumsy heist underneath a race track. 

There's also a sportslike about a breakdancing professor, an overly-endowed gymnast, and a sharpshooting cyberpunk. 

And does the world need yet another sports game that dryly simulates darts for the fifteenth time, or would we be better off with a sportslike about an intense teenage darts prodigy who definitely never needed a fake ID?

Freed from the shackles of the sports game genre, **the sportslike can finally be what sports are: made of people.**

Spectator and player, amateur and pro, young and old. Funny, weird, sexy, angry, and tragic. History, culture, society.

If sports are life, if sports mean the world to you - then you'll find a lot to like in the sportslike.

## Where to find sportslikes

We wrote the Sportslike Manifesto to crystalize our thinking for our upcoming game [Tryhard](https://tryhardgame.com), *"a sports RPG about managing an underdog rugby club in New Zealand."*

But here's some other games that we consider to be sportslikes:

- [Golf Story (2017)](https://sidebargames.com/golfstory/), is *"the story of a golfer, forced to give up all that he holds dear for one final shot at accomplishing his dream."*
- [Roller Drama (2023)](https://www.open-lab.com/games/rollerdrama/) is *"a narrative and a strategic real-time sports game about five girls playing roller derby in an oppressive and surveillance-based society."*
- [Sudden Death (2024)](https://dominoclub.itch.io/sudden-death) is *a "romantic sports fiction" visual novel about a renegade Australian Rules Football club in a speculative future league.*
- [Despelote (2025)](https://despelote.game) is *"a slice-of-life adventure about childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001."*

Thank you for supporting new sports games; thank you for supporting sportslikes.
