## Most sports games don't know anything about sports.

Sports games don't know anything about taking kids to practice, playing a pick-up game with friends, or watching the finals, screaming.

That is, **sports games don't know anything about your everyday experience of sports.**

Sports games also don't know anything about the smell of the locker room, the agony of sore muscles, or the comfort of tying your shoes five times for good luck. 

Which is to say, **sports games don't know anything about athletes as people.**

Sports books, shows, movies - they're all about people because **sports are made of people.**

## SPORTS REALISM is about making games that reflect the social reality of sports.

Amateur and pro, player and spectator, young and old. Sports are funny, weird, sexy, angry, and tragic - sports are everything, and so sports realism strives for everything.

Reject the fake realism of licensed brands and fancy graphics. Brands and graphics aren't real; people are real.

If sports is life, if sports truly mean the world - then sports realism must reflect life and the world.

## Where to find SPORTS REALISM

We wrote the Sports Realism Manifesto to crystalize our thinking for our upcoming sports realist game [Tryhard](https://tryhardgame.com), "a sports RPG about managing an underdog rugby club in New Zealand."

But we're not the only ones working in sports realism...

- In [Golf Story (2017)](https://sidebargames.com/golfstory/), you "play the story of a golfer, forced to give up all that he holds dear for one final shot at accomplishing his dream."
- [Roller Drama (2023)](https://www.open-lab.com/games/rollerdrama/) is "a narrative and a strategic real-time sports game about five girls playing roller derby in an oppressive and surveillance-based society."
- [Sudden Death (2024)](https://dominoclub.itch.io/sudden-death) is a "romantic sports fiction" visual novel about a renegade Australian Rules Football club in a near-far Jon Bois-ian future.
- [Despelote (2025)](https://despelote.game) is "a slice-of-life adventure about childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001."

Thank you for demanding more of your sports games and supporting sports realism.
