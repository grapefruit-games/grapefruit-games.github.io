## Most sports games don't know anything about sports.

Sports games don't know anything about taking your kids to practice, playing a pick-up game with your friends, or watching the finals while screaming at the top of your lungs. That is, **sports games don't know anything about your everyday experience of sports.**

Sports games also don't know anything about the funky smell of the locker room, the lowkey agony of waking up with sore muscles, or the comfort of tying your shoes exactly five times for good luck. Which is to say, **sports games don't know anything about athletes as people.**

That's the keyword: **people.** Sports books, shows, movies - they all know that sports are made of people. Yet somehow, **most sports games don't know anything about people, our lives, or the world we live in.**

## SPORTS REALISM is about making games that reflect the social reality of sports.

Amateur and pro, player and spectator, young and old. Sports are funny, weird, sexy, angry, and tragic - sports are everything, and so must sports realism strive.

Sports realism is not the fake realism of licensed brands and fancy graphics. Brands and graphics aren't real; people are real. Thus, people form the reality of sports realism.

If sports is life, if sports truly mean the world to you - then please, support SPORTS REALISM.

## Where to find SPORTS REALISM

We wrote the Sports Realism Manifesto to crystalize our thinking for our upcoming sports realist game [Tryhard](https://tryhardgame.com), "a sports RPG about managing an underdog rugby club in New Zealand."

But we're not the only ones working in sports realism...

- In [Golf Story (2017)](https://sidebargames.com/golfstory/), you "play the story of a golfer, forced to give up all that he holds dear for one final shot at accomplishing his dream."
- [Roller Drama (2023)](https://www.open-lab.com/games/rollerdrama/) is "a narrative and a strategic real-time sports game about five girls playing roller derby in an oppressive and surveillance-based society."
- [Sudden Death (2024)](https://dominoclub.itch.io/sudden-death) is a "romantic sports fiction" visual novel about a renegade Australian Rules Football club in a near-far Jon Bois-ian future.
- [Despelote (2025)](https://despelote.game) is "a slice-of-life adventure about childhood and the magical grip soccer held over the people of Quito, Ecuador in 2001."
