## TACTICAL TURN-BASED AUTO BATTLE MATCHES ##
- Fresh blend of tactical RPG, auto battler, and sports mechanics.
- Outsmart the other team across hours of handmade levels and challenging training drills based on real-life rugby coaching.
- Craft the perfect squad from dozens of different builds and skills inspired by rugby history from all over the world.
- RUGBY KNOWLEDGE IS OPTIONAL. Don't know anything about rugby? That's OK, most rugby players don't either.

## MANAGE A FAILING CLUB, TURN IT AROUND ##
- Search for club sponsors and fundraise for new equipment.
- Recruit new members. You'll need a secretary, treasurer, and patron too.
- File paperwork and send emails. Argue with the bank! The possibilities are endless.

## LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE IN VIRTUAL NEW ZEALAND ##
- Even if you lose a match, the story mode continues, just like in real-life.
- Explore an embarrassingly authentic 3D recreation of TƒÅmaki Makaurau / Auckland, the 5th largest city in Australasia!*
- Keep your day job, pay the rent, and feed your dog... but definitely ***DO NOT fall in love.***
